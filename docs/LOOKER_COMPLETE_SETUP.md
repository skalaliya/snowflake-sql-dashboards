# üîç Complete Looker Setup Guide

Too easy! Let's get you **Looker-ready** now. I'll give you both paths:

* **A) Looker Studio** (free, quick charts)
* **B) Looker (Google Cloud Looker)** with ready-to-paste LookML

First, 60-second prep in Snowflake so access is clean and least-privilege.

## 0Ô∏è‚É£ Snowflake Prep (Run Once)

### Quick Setup (Use existing roles):
```sql
-- You can use your existing DASHBOARD_ANALYST_ROLE
-- Or run the dedicated BI security setup:
-- See: sql/bi_security_setup.sql
```

### Dedicated Looker Setup:
```sql
-- Roles and grants (least privilege for BI)
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS LOOKER_ROLE;

GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH TO ROLE LOOKER_ROLE;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE TPCH_DASHBOARDS TO ROLE LOOKER_ROLE;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA TPCH_DASHBOARDS.PUBLIC TO ROLE LOOKER_ROLE;

GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA TPCH_DASHBOARDS.PUBLIC TO ROLE LOOKER_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS  IN SCHEMA TPCH_DASHBOARDS.PUBLIC TO ROLE LOOKER_ROLE;

-- Keep future objects visible too
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA TPCH_DASHBOARDS.PUBLIC TO ROLE LOOKER_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS  IN SCHEMA TPCH_DASHBOARDS.PUBLIC TO ROLE LOOKER_ROLE;

-- Optional: a dedicated BI user
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS LOOKER_USER
  PASSWORD = 'LookerSecure2024!'
  DEFAULT_ROLE = LOOKER_ROLE
  DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = COMPUTE_WH
  DEFAULT_NAMESPACE = TPCH_DASHBOARDS.PUBLIC;

GRANT ROLE LOOKER_ROLE TO USER LOOKER_USER;
```

You can also keep using `ALGORYTHMOS` with `DASHBOARD_ANALYST_ROLE`, but the dedicated user keeps things tidy.

## A) Connect **Looker Studio** (Free)

There are two ways in Studio:

### Option A1 ‚Äî Use the **Snowflake connector** (if present in your Studio)

1. Go to **lookerstudio.google.com ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Data source**.
2. Search **Snowflake**. Pick the native or Google connector if you see it.
3. Fill:

   * **Server:** `JHYWOUK-WA83239.snowflakecomputing.com`
   * **Warehouse:** `COMPUTE_WH`
   * **Database:** `TPCH_DASHBOARDS`
   * **Schema:** `PUBLIC`
   * **Role:** `LOOKER_ROLE` (or `DASHBOARD_ANALYST_ROLE`)
   * **Username:** `LOOKER_USER` (or `ALGORYTHMOS`)
   * **Password:** your Snowflake password
4. Authorise ‚Üí choose tables/views:

   * `CUSTOMER_LINEITEM_PROFILE` (4.5M records)
   * `V_CUSTOMER_DETAILS` (150K records)
   * `V_ORDER_DETAILS` (1.5M records)
   * `V_MONTHLY_REVENUE_BY_REGION` (400 records)
   * `V_MARKET_SEGMENT_ANALYSIS` (25 records)
5. Click **Connect**, then **Create Report**.

### Option A2 ‚Äî If you don't see a native connector

Pick a **Partner connector** (e.g., CData, Dataddo, etc.). Same fields as above. Most have free trials, works fine for POC.

### Starter Charts (2 Minutes)

* **Monthly Revenue:** Dimension = `O_ORDERDATE` (set to Month), Metric = `SUM(PRICE_AFTER_DISCOUNT)`, Breakdown = `O_ORDERSTATUS`.
* **Top Customers:** From `V_CUSTOMER_DETAILS` or an aggregated view, Bar chart on `customer_id` vs `SUM(revenue)`.

## B) Connect **Looker (Google Cloud Looker)** with LookML

### B1) Add the Snowflake Connection (Admin)

1. Looker Admin ‚Üí **Database ‚Üí Connections ‚Üí New**.
2. **Dialect:** Snowflake.
3. **Host:** `JHYWOUK-WA83239.snowflakecomputing.com`
4. **Database:** `TPCH_DASHBOARDS`
5. **Schema:** `PUBLIC`
6. **Username/Password:** `LOOKER_USER` + password (or your ALGORYTHMOS creds)
7. **Warehouse:** `COMPUTE_WH`
8. **Role:** `LOOKER_ROLE` (or `DASHBOARD_ANALYST_ROLE`)
9. **Additional JDBC params** (nice to have):

   * `CLIENT_SESSION_KEEP_ALIVE=true`
   * `OCSPFailOpen=true`
10. Test ‚Üí Save as connection name: `snowflake_tpch`

### B2) Import the Complete LookML Model

**I've created the complete LookML model for you!**  
**File:** `config/looker_model.lkml`

This model includes:
- ‚úÖ **Main customer profile explore** with 4.5M records
- ‚úÖ **Customer demographics view** 
- ‚úÖ **Regional revenue analysis**
- ‚úÖ **Market segment performance**
- ‚úÖ **Pre-built measures** and dimensions
- ‚úÖ **Optimized derived tables** for performance

### B3) Deploy and Use

1. **Copy** the LookML from `config/looker_model.lkml`
2. **Create new project** in Looker
3. **Paste** the model files
4. **Validate LookML ‚Üí Deploy to Production**
5. **Start exploring:**

   * **Orders & Revenue**: `order_date (Month)` √ó `revenue`, pivot by `order_status`.
   * **Regional Analysis**: `region` vs `revenue` with time filters
   * **Customer Analytics**: `market_segment` performance analysis

## üìä Ready-to-Use Dashboards

### Executive Dashboard
**Explores:** `customer_lineitem_profile`
- Revenue trends over time
- Order status performance
- Customer count growth
- Average order value

### Regional Performance
**Explores:** `monthly_revenue_by_region` 
- Geographic revenue mapping
- Regional growth comparison
- Market penetration analysis

### Customer Analytics
**Explores:** `customer_details`, `market_segment_analysis`
- Customer segmentation
- Lifetime value analysis
- Purchase behavior patterns

## üîß Troubleshooting Quick Wins

* **Auth errors in Studio/Looker**: clear saved credentials and re-enter, double-check the trailing `$` in your password.
* **No tables appear**: role lacks privileges. Re-run the GRANTs above.
* **Warehouse suspended**: Snowflake will auto-resume if the role has `OPERATE` on `COMPUTE_WH` (ACCOUNTADMIN can set once).
* **Slow queries**: Use the analytical views (`V_*`) for faster aggregations.
